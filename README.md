# Lem-in 

Made for UnitFactory's <b>Lem_in</b> project. A project with my implementation of the shortest path search algorithm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search"><b>(BFS)</b></a>

## Description:

Your ant colony must move from on point to another. How do you do it in the shortest time possible? This project will get you acquainted with graph traversal algorithms: your program will have to intelligently select paths and precise movements used by the ants.
